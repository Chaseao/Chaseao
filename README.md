<h3>
  Who I Am
</h3>
<p>
  I am a Game Designer with a specialty in Unity / C# development currently studying at The Ohio State University. I’ve created several small games with gameplay features like inventory, combat, and skill systems. I’ve also worked with teams to create UI systems that are engaging for the player to interact with.

<h3>
  Current Project

<p>
  Right now, I'm a part-time gameplay programmer for a Columbus-based indie startup AfroDuck Studios, where I'm working on Zakumba: Astraia, an upcoming RPG.
