<h3>
  Who I Am
</h3>
<p>
   I am a Ohio State University Digital Animation and Interactive Media Graduate Student with a focus on User Interfaces for Mixed Reality Applications. I’ve both worked on and led the development of several small games with gameplay features like inventory, combat, and skill systems. In addition, I have spent time studying how to create UI systems that are engaging for the player.

  Right now, I'm a part-time Augmented Reality Researcher working to develope an interactive user interface for the Microsoft Hololens 2 to both view and provide feedback to an AI Generated coating path plan for robots on an assembly line.
